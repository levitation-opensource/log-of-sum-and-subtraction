% Method for calculating precise logarithm of a subtraction
% The method is based on the notion that
% ln(a - b) = ln{exp[ln(a) - ln(b)] - 1} + ln(b) IF a > b.
% It is assumed that a > b. The method does not check the validity of the inputs.
%
% The method requires calling only one exp() and one log(), instead of two exp() and one log() in the basic solution. 
% Additionally, the proposed method has the critical advantage of not overflowing in case of large numbers of a and b.
%
% Usage: R = sub_lns(a_ln, b_ln) 
% where
% a_ln - logarithm of the minuend
% b_ln - logarithm of the substrahend
% R - precise logarithm of the result of the subtraction
